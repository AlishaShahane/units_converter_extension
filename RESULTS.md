## Methods
For experimenting with the Units converter, we had decided upon a variety of measurements including white box and black box testing. Another factor was the time taken to conduct the experiment using our selected product, and its counterpart available in the market. <br>

### White Box Testing - <br>
These metrics are a result of testing a product with the code visible to the tester. They are: <br>
 - Code Readability <br>
 - Documentation Testing <br>
 - Ease of adding a new feature <br>

### Black Box Testing - <br>
These metrics are a result of testing a product based on its desired outputs and behaviour, without seeing the actual code. They are: <br>
 - Ease of downloading and installing <br>
 - Ease of execution <br>
 - Usability <br>
 - How likely you are to invest in this product <br>
 
### Comparative Experiment: 
For quantifying the sellability and market value of the product, it is necessary to compare its functioning and market value with other products of the same domain. Hence, we gave our testers another Google Chrome extension which converted units. The product given for comparison was: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unit-converter/igjeajmonjofckmiheidpmebpmdbbiam?hl=en

### Experiment 1: <br>
 - The first experiment consisted of comparing the dimensions of two waffle makers on Amazon.com which had their measurements in inches and testers had to choose a waffle having height less than 10 cms. 
 - The first waffle maker’s dimensions were supposed to be converted using the competitive product and the second waffle maker’s were converted using our product. <br>
### Experiment 2: <br>
 - The second experiment consisted of comparing the area of two houses, having an area given in square feet. The testers were required to find the house having area less than 195 square metres. 
 - The first house’s dimensions were supposed to be converted using the competitive product and the second house’s were converted using our product. <br>
  
Time taken for the conversion process of each observation using each extension was measured.
