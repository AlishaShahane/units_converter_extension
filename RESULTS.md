## Methods
For experimenting with the Units converter, we had decided upon a variety of measurements including white box and black box testing. Another factor was the time taken to conduct the experiment using our selected product, and its counterpart available in the market. <br>

### White Box Testing - <br>
These metrics are a result of testing a product with the code visible to the tester. They are: <br>
 - Code Readability <br>
 - Documentation Testing <br>
 - Ease of adding a new feature <br>

### Black Box Testing - <br>
These metrics are a result of testing a product based on its desired outputs and behaviour, without seeing the actual code. They are: <br>
 - Ease of downloading and installing <br>
 - Ease of execution <br>
 - Usability <br>
 - How likely you are to invest in this product <br>
