## Methods
For experimenting with the Units converter, we had decided upon a variety of measurements including white box and black box testing. Another factor was the time taken to conduct the experiment using our selected product, and its counterpart available in the market. <br>

### White Box Testing - <br>
These metrics are a result of testing a product with the code visible to the tester. They are: <br>
 - Code Readability <br>
 - Documentation Testing <br>
 - Ease of adding a new feature <br>

### Black Box Testing - <br>
These metrics are a result of testing a product based on its desired outputs and behaviour, without seeing the actual code. They are: <br>
 - Ease of downloading and installing <br>
 - Ease of execution <br>
 - Usability <br>
 - How likely you are to invest in this product <br>
 
### Comparative Experiment: 
For quantifying the sellability and market value of the product, it is necessary to compare its functioning and market value with other products of the same domain. Hence, we gave our testers another Google Chrome extension which converted units. The product given for comparison was: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unit-converter/igjeajmonjofckmiheidpmebpmdbbiam?hl=en

### Experiment 1: <br>
 - The first experiment consisted of comparing the dimensions of two waffle makers on Amazon.com which had their measurements in inches and testers had to choose a waffle having height less than 10 cms. 
 - The first waffle maker’s dimensions were supposed to be converted using the competitive product and the second waffle maker’s were converted using our product. <br>
### Experiment 2: <br>
 - The second experiment consisted of comparing the area of two houses, having an area given in square feet. The testers were required to find the house having area less than 195 square metres. 
 - The first house’s dimensions were supposed to be converted using the competitive product and the second house’s were converted using our product. <br>
  
Time taken for the conversion process of each observation using each extension was measured. 



## Materials

The lab trials were conducted using the following materials:

- Zoom: The communication of the lab trial was done over a Zoom meeting and each participant was allotted 30 minutes to perform testing.
 
- Google form: During the testing, each participant was required to fill the following Google form:
  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexJgJxwnPkSr_mYZVBqKQKKGYIQtdvx88kXuYoqzIDqBUddw/viewform?usp=sf_link
  
- Baseline Application: In order to compare the performance of our project, we used the following existing chrome extension as a baseline application:      https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unit-converter/igjeajmonjofckmiheidpmebpmdbbiam?hl=en
 
- Experiment document: In order to compare the ease with which the users can work with the baseline extension and our project extension, 
we designed two experiments mentioned in the below document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IfqAOpouN26ex-qVaURnJih9sjpZKCe4Gb8T8-OF4h4/edit

- Google sheet:
We used a Google sheet to note down the time taken by the participants to perform the experiments using the baseline extension and our project extension respectively.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


## Observations

### White Box Testing - <br>

### Black Box Testing - <br>

### Experiment 1: <br>
The following graph depicts the amount of time taken by the users to complete the Experiment 1 with and without the extension.

### Experiment 2: <br>
The following graph depicts the amount of time taken by the users to complete Experiment 2 with and without the extension.

## Analysis
In white box testing, the tester assumes the role of a software developer and the three metrics that matter most to them are documentation, code readability and ability to add a new feature. From the graph, it is evident that testers found the code and documentation quite readable, but there is a weak correlation between code readability and their ability to add a new feature. The ability to add a new feature is dependent on the familiarity of the tester with JavaScript. Thus, testers who were familiar with JavaScript were more likely to add a new feature as compared to others.
